# EssentialsTracker
The COPEVID-19 supply tracker helps track inventory of essential supplies from personal care to food at nearby stores. Since inventory is hardly accurate on store websites (if they have them for local stores), the application uses the power of crowd sourcing to get this information. When a neighbor goes out to get supplies, they can easily mark the status of essential items (stocked, limited, or out of stock). Other neighbors can see the status of an item at a store and when it was last updated. They can search for an item to see where it might be in stock near them or search for a store to see the status of different items they may be looking for.
